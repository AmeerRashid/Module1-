My model is of the bust of Saint Thomas Aquinas in Simard Hall lobby in the University of Ottawa. It was sculpted by Robert Ulmann and unveiled in 1957 (Adam, 2017). The sculpture is made from bronze and it has a marble base. The bronze seems to be superglued to the marble. The bust is in the geography building of the university which is strange unless it doubles as the philosophy department as well.

Saint Thomas Aquinas was born in 1225 in Sicily and he died in 1274 in Fossanova. He was an Italian Catholic priest and he had a huge influence on modern philosophy and theology. He was one of the forward thinkers of the Catholic Church who studied the works of Aristotle and one of the first to call him 'The Philosopher'(Kennedy, 1913). He is also the father of Thomism which is a school of philosophical thought which emerged as a result of Aquinas' works.
