My model is of the bust of Saint Thomas Aquinas in Simard Hall lobby in the University of Ottawa. It was sculpted by Robert Ulmann and unveiled in 1957 (Adam, 2017). The sculpture is made from bronze and it has a marble base. The bronze seems to be superglued to the marble. The bust is in the geography building of the university which is strange unless it doubles as the philosophy department as well.
